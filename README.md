## TIGER - A Tiny Full Compiler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gangliao/TIGER.svg?token=bQUUVqcsZpghUieTvsMM&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gangliao/TIGER/builds)

This tiny compiler includes both front end and back end.

> Front end: Grammar Rules, LL(1) Parse Table, Syntax and Semantic Check and Intermediate Code.

> Back end: IR Optimization (Intra-block CFG optimization), MIPS Register Allocation, Instruction Selection and Code Generation.

### How to Build

0. development environment

	Currently, this project repository is maintained on github publicly and also been deployed on Travis CI.
	It supports both Ubuntu and Mac OS X.

1. build:

	```bash
		# cd project dir
		cd Tiger-Compiler
		# build scanner, parser, generator
		mkdir build && cd build
		# cmake building tool
		cmake ..
		make -j4
	```

2. run:

	You can parsing test cases named `*.tiger` under `/testCases2` to generate IR code.
	Default it will utilize **CFG optimized technique** to generate MIPS asm code.

	```bash
		# verbose mode: "-d to implement a verbose mode"
		./src/parser <filename> -d
	```

	If you want to use the **naive** mode to generate asm code, simply issue:

	```bash
		./src/parser <filename> -d -naive
	```

3. test:

	In [testCases2](testCases2) directory, it includes a test script `test.sh` to execute all test cases and
	generate the corresponding asm files `*.naive.s` and `*.cfg.s`.

	After souce code is compiled, you can simply issue the commands:

	```bash
	cd testCases2
	sh ./test.sh
	```

### Test Cases

We passed all tests cases which provided by TA.

Please check out the details in report [Phase2_Testing_and_Output.pdf](Phase2_Testing_and_Output.pdf) from current directory, which includes test cases and their quality comparisons for naive and CFG intra-block register allocation.

### Accomplishment

- [x] Register allocation code
	- [x] Naive
	- [x] CFG and intra block allocation
	- [ ] EBB and intra-EBB allocation
	- [x] Whole function register allocation
	- [x] Live Range Analysis and Graph Coloring
- [x] Instruction selection and generation code
- [x] Passes tests using generated code executing on simulator.
- [x] Report (desgin Internals, how to build, run, code quality comparisions, etc.)
